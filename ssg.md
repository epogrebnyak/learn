# Static site generators (SSG)

A follow-up to https://twitter.com/PogrebnyakE/status/1267016141848883202

Lessons learned:

- blogging, landings and documentation are separate domains for static site generators(SSG)
- maintaining visually attractive themes is hard, it is a lot of work
- themes not easily portable between 
- some good themes/SSG may fall out scope for subjective reasons, can work well for other users
- many cool themes historically developed for Jekyll and still Wordpress
- Github Pages supports some blogging and not docs themes, need install Ruby otherwise
- port of mkdocs-material to Hugo is 2017, and Hugo versions are way ahead
- JS-based (React/Vue) generators are a world of its own to be discovered
- top SSG amount 40k stars on Github (Next, Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll) and next round of contenders around 10k (python-based)

Student project idea:

- sort Hugo themes by popularity (stars) vs activity (last commit date or commits last 3 months) 
- Academic can easily get into top ranks in both, also has great language support
- can help distinguish stable, emerging and forgotten themes (theme catalogs ususlly list them)
- from a user story perspective - one may choose the theme first, SSG second

Some 2020 reality:
