# Python, software engineering and documentation

This site lists my findings about Python, software engineering and documentation.

**Python**:

- I recommend [the following three resources](python/start.md) as Python language 
  introductions.
- Lectures like ["Beyond PEP8"][pep8-talk] by [Raymond Herringer](https://twitter.com/raymondh) make you a better Python 
  developper.
- Check [trending on Github][trending] and [user surveys][surveys] to see what is cool and 
  popular in python.
- I collected a few links about [python project maintence](python/packaging.md)
  and [unit tests](python/unit_testing.md).

**Software engineering**. See a list of [books][books] and [wise quotes][wise] from other sources.

**Static site generators**. This site is built with [Jupyter Book][jb], a tool that uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and a custom variety of Markdown (MyST) with
emphasis on interactivity and code execution. Other popular static site generators [described here][ssg].
