# Python, software engineering and documentation

This site lists my findings about Python, software engineering and writing documentation.

**Python**:

- I recommend [these three resources](python/start.md) as good introductions to Python. Trekhleb is a set of excercises and the other two make a balanced reading.
- Lectures like ["Beyond PEP8"][pep8-talk] by [Raymond Herringer](https://twitter.com/raymondh) push you to be a better Python developper.
- Check [trending on Github][trending] and [JetBrains annual user surveys][surveys] to see 
  what is cool and popular in Python.
- I collected a few ideas and links about [project maintenance](python/packaging.md)
  and [unit testing](python/unit_testing.md). [just][just] and [pytest][pytest] are my friends.

**Software engineering**. See a list of [essential books][books] and [thought-provoking quotes][wise].

**Static site generators**. This site is built with [Jupyter Book][jb], a tool that uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and a custom variety of Markdown (MyST) with
emphasis on interactivity, code execution and hopefully PDF rendering. Other popular static site generators [described here][ssg].

**Add more stuff I did**: Julia, 7 classes of Haskell, data projects (boo), mid-tech data science, optimizations, reproducible research, missed-semester, tools for economists, Econometrics Navigator, Nim/Rust, and [a time-keeping command line tool I often forget about][watson].
