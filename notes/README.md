# Python, software engineering and documentation

This site lists my findings about Python, software engineering and writing documentation.

**Python**:

- I recommend [these three resources](python/start.md) as good introductions to Python. Trekhleb is a set of excercises and other two nake a balanced reading.
- Lectures like ["Beyond PEP8"][pep8-talk] by [Raymond Herringer](https://twitter.com/raymondh) make you a better Python  developper.
- Check [trending on Github][trending] and [user surveys][surveys] to see what is cool and 
  popular in Python.
- I collected a few ideas and links about [project maintenance](python/packaging.md)
  and [unit testing](python/unit_testing.md) and suggest [just][just] and [pytest][pytest] as your friends.

[trending]: https://github.com/trending/python
[surveys]: https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/python/
[pytest]: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/
[just]: https://github.com/casey/just

**Software engineering**. See a list of [essential books][books] and [wise quotes][wise].

[books]: programming/books.md
[wise]: programming/wisdom.md

**Static site generators**. This site is built with [Jupyter Book][jb], a tool that uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and a custom variety of Markdown (MyST) with
emphasis on interactivity, code execution and hopefully PDF rendering. Other popular static site generators [described here][ssg].

[jb]: https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html
[ssg]: static_sites/intro.md

**Add more**: Julia, Haskell, data projects (eg boo), mid-tech, optimisations, reproducible research, missed semester, tools for economists, econometrics, Nim/Rust, time-keeping.

**Wanted**: 

- good embedding of tweets in Myst
- build same markdown source with other SSG
- see what is cool in Twitter
